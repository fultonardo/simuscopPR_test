##------arguments for generating sequencing reads------##

## [required] fasta reference file from which reads will be sampled
ref = ./testData/ref.fa.gz

## [required] a model file generated by "seqToProfile" utility
profile = ./testData/Illumina_GenomeAnalyzerIIx.profile

## [optional] files defining the variations (indel, SNV and CNV) to simulate
variation = ./testData/variations_tumor.txt

## [optional] file defining the SNPs to simulate
snp = ./testData/snp.txt

## [required] popolation names (comma-separated).
name = clone1, clone2, clone3, normal

## [optional] abundance file (the agrument is noneffective if there is only one popolation defined in "name")
abundance = ./testData/abundance_tumor.txt

## [required] output directory
output = ./results

## [optional] sequence layout, should be "SE" for single end or "PE" for paired-end (default: "SE")
layout = SE

## [optional] the number of threads to use (default: 1)
threads = 4

## [optional] print the intermediate information, should be 0 or 1 (default: 1)
verbose = 1

## [required] sequencing coverage
coverage = 10

## [optional] insert size for paired end sequencing (default: 350, only effective when the "layout" is set to "PE")
insertSize = 200
