##------arguments for generating sequencing reads------##

## [required] fasta reference file from which reads will be sampled
ref = ./testData/ref.fa.gz

## [required] a model file generated by "seqToProfile" utility
profile = ./testData/Illumina_HiSeq2500.profile

## [optional] files defining the variations (indel, SNV and CNV) to simulate
variation = ./testData/variations.txt

## [optional] file defining the SNPs to simulate
snp = ./testData/snp.txt

## [optional] file defining target regions for sequencing. If the argument is not specified, sequencing data of all chromosomes defined in the reference will be produced. 
target = ./testData/exon_regions.bed

## [required] popolation names (comma-separated).
name = test

## [required] output directory
output = ./results

## [optional] sequence layout, should be "SE" for single end or "PE" for paired-end (default: "SE")
layout = PE

## [optional] the number of threads to use (default: 1)
threads = 2

## [optional] print the intermediate information, should be 0 or 1 (default: 1)
verbose = 1

## [required] sequencing coverage
coverage = 100

## [optional] insert size for paired end sequencing (default: 350, only effective when the "layout" is set to "PE")
insertSize = 200
